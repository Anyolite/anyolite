**Describe the problem**
Please describe your problem in a detailed way here, so others can understand it.

Some tips:
* Be objective
* Make sure you read the documentation and wiki
* Include all error messages and warnings potentially related to the problem
* If the problem depends on specific steps, describe them in a way others can reproduce consistently

**To Reproduce**
Please require a minimal working code example on how to reproduce the issue, if possible.

Avoid any unnecessary detail, but make sure the problem still persists in the example. If you are unable to provide a minimal working example, you may also refer to a specific repository instead.

**Expected behavior**
If something does not work the way you would expect it to, please describe the expected behavior shortly. This is only necessary if you don't encounter obvious errors or crashes.

**Platform and version**
Please describe which versions of Crystal and Anyolite you are using, which Anyolite flags you are using and which platform you are on.

**Additional context**
Is there anything else you want to mention that did not fit into the previous sections?
