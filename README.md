# Anyolite

Anyolite is planned to be a crystal shard which adds a full mruby interpreter to crystal.

# Goals of this project

This project aims to provide an mruby interpreter to Crystal projects, allowing scripting in a language very close to Crystal itself, therefore combining the best of both worlds.

# Why this name?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyolite

In short, it is a rare variant of the crystalline mineral called zoisite, with a ruby and crystal shards (of pargasite) embedded.

The term 'anyoli' means 'green' in the Maasai language, thus naming 'anyolite'.
